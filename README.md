In this project, I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I trained this classifier, then exported it for use in my application. I used this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories. 

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Loading the image dataset and create a pipeline. 
Building and Training an image classifier on this dataset. 
Using the trained model to perform inference on flower images.
